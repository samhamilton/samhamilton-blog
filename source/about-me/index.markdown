Well my name is Sam Hamilton

I live in Shanghai, China and founded [Mad Jungle](http://www.madjungle.co.uk) - a e-commerce company selling a broad range of products.

I moved to China in 2004 when my last boss asked me to move with him to start the company.
I also find the time to play with a few personal sites too, nothing like keeping the juices flowing so to speak, they are broad ranging but normally follow a celebrity theme (my parents fault who were both in the industry and I seem to have caught the bug!)

You can find me:
