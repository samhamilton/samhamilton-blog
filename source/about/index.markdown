{% img /images/mug-shot.png Sam Hamilton %} 

Well it can't be a surprise that my name is Sam Hamilton.

I am currently living in Hangzhou, China and founded [Mad Jungle](http://www.madjungle.co.uk) - a e-commerce company selling a broad range of products in 2010. Though my true day job is working at [OrderWithMe](http://www.orderwithme.com) as VP of Technology & Logistics where we help out both small and large businesses source products from China. 

I moved to China in 2004 when my last boss asked to move with him to start the company in Shanghai, which we grew to about 150 employees and selling a range of 7,000 locally sourced and warehoused accessory products shipping all over the world direct to the end customer.
