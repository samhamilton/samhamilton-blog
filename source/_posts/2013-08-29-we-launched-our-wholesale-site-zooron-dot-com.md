Its been a busy few months, first Gina and I moved back to Shanghai after finding a great apartment here, then we launched our first [B2B wholesale site Zooron.com](http://www.zooron.com). We launched Zooron because we are fed up of people getting ripped off when buying from China. China is an amazing place with a massive selection of products ready to be sold by retailers but we think it needs someone to organise and safely dispatch those products. We are launching with 300 products, mainly in the business and industrial categories and plan to add many more from our trusted supplier we have worked with over the last 9 years.
