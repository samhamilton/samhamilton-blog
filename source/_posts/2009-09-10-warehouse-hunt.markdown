So once again eBay are changing the rules for sellers so once again we need to work out how to react to their changes to keep the business alive. This time round the changes mean that shipping time is critical so our 14 day delivery from Shanghai can only live for so long, so off we go to Shenzhen to find a cross dock and a new speedier delivery system.

This should mean that customers get their goods quicker but costs will likely increase as well but doing business in the south of China is a different beast compared to the north after all most of the goods exported to the world are made down there and then shipped out through Hong Kong.
