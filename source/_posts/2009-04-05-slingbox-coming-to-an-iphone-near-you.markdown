It seems that one way or another everything is coming to an iPhone, good job I just got a 3G one then. [Slingbox are bringing out a player for iPhone](http://www.engadget.com/2009/04/02/older-slingboxes-wont-work-with-slingplayer-for-iphone/) - this is dreadful news as now I feel the need to purchase a slingbox, place it in my Mum's house in the UK and then stream random crap British TV half way rounds the world.
