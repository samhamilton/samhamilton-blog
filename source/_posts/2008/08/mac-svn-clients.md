I started to look round for SVN clients to update our internal repos - windows and linux ones are easy, Mac however is bit harder.

So far the testing includes:

* [Syncro SVN](http://www.syncrosvnclient.com/)
* [Versions](http://www.versionsapp.com/)

Going to use them for a while and see which one pans out.
