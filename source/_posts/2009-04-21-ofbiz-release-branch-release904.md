So finally after months of planning and much talk on the mailing lists [OFBiz have branched](http://news.prnewswire.com/DisplayReleaseContent.aspx?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/04-20-2009/0005008924&EDATE=) once more, but this time the collective I will be making use of the [branch](http://ofbiz.apache.org). There are enough features now in this branch for us to make use of over the next year but what we really need is stability. I can see this process being massive in terms of both changes to our internal code and also time of the developers but i think it will be worth the effort. Going to wait a few weeks for some of the simple bugs to be fixed but its on the developers road map very soon.
