So got up this morning and was reading [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org) with a cup of coffee and what do I read.... [China Sensoring Flickr](http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/06/09/1914226)

So as with most things related to the Chinese firewall you have to make sure it apples to you too and it does - I can get onto [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com) but cant see any images.

And I was going to update my photos this week too.
