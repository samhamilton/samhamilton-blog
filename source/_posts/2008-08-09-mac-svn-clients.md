I started to look round for SVN clients to update our internal repos - windows and linux ones are easy, Mac however is bit harder.

So far the testing includes:



	
  * [Syncro SVN](http://www.syncrosvnclient.com/)

	
  * [Verisions](http://www.versionsapp.com/)


Going to use them for a while and see which one pans out.
