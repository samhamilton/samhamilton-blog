A random blog post reminded me to get my goals for 2009 in order so here they are:



	
  * Earn enough money to support my Mum

	
  * Finish getting my MCSE even though I no longer like Mircosoft

	
  * Get my RHCE

	
  * Loose 10KG


More geeky than expected and not a huge list but I think with work carrying on at its breakneck speed it should be enough to keep me occuopied for a while.
