The Chinese government has decided to change the amount of foreign currency exchanged into RMB on a personal level from $50,000 per month to $50,000 per year!

Quite a change and this caused great questions for the business that need to be answered - general taxpayer or warehouse in Hong Kong!?!

The change to come into effect Feb 1, 2007!
