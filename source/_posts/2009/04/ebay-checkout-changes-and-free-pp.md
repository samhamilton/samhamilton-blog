Nothing like a moving target, eBay updates the rules of the game again

* [Third-party checkouts changing, not banned](http://www.tamebay.com/2009/04/third-party-checkouts-changing-not-banned.html)
* [Third-party checkout / checkout redirect clarification from ChannelAdvisor](http://ebaystrategies.blogs.com/ebay_strategies/2009/04/thirdparty-checkout-checkout-redirect-clarification.html)
* [eBay UKâ€™s big announcement: mandatory free P&P expanded, easier returns](http://www.tamebay.com/2009/04/ebay-uks-big-announcement-mandatory-free-pp-expanded-easier-returns.html)

We use Channel Advisor to handle our checkout systems for eBay customers and any changes to this are concerning as they probably would have a negative impact on sales, if eBay really wants to reduce the use of checkouts then they better make sure it does not affect sales!
