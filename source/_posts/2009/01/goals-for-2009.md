title: Goals for 2009
categories: [Random Stuff]

A random blog post reminded me to get my goals for 2009 in order so here they are:

* Earn enough money to support my Mum
* Finish getting my MCSE even though I no longer like Microsoft
* Get my RHCE
* Loose 10KG

More geeky than expected and not a huge list but I think with work carrying on at its breakneck speed it should be enough to keep me occupied for a while.
