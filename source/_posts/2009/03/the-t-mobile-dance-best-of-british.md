OK I have just watched this and its brilliant, but what it spanks of is the fact that British commercials are just so original! Don't know why but here in China most commercials are like something from a late nightÂ  bad cable channel and somehow if you tried this in America I get the feeling someone would call 911 and that would be the end of it.

Any way check it out.
