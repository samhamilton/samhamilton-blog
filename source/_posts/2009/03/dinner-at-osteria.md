Had a very pleasant dinner last night at [Osteria](http://www.smartshanghai.com/venue/4150/Osteria_shanghai) last night, the place was full the the brim so we had to wait for a table. Food was good but the service was hit or miss. For example we got asked if we wanted the desert menu which arrived quickly but then no-one followed up and we totally forgot to order desert and ended up just getting the bill and leaving. So I suppose its their loss, and it kept the rather tempting warm pear tart from my growing waist line. Total bill for two including a bottle of wine 630RMB.
