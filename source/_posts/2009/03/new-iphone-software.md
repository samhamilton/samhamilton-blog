I have had a iPhone for a week now and just starting to get into the whole experience and culture but reading about the new features coming soon I think Apple will be onto something here.

The only feature I have not read that they will be fixing is meeting invites - something I assumed was so basic when I was sitting in a meeting the other day and tried to create a follow up meeting and add people to it.

Have a read and see the [nice screenshots here](http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/09/03/17/iphone_os_3_0_first_impressions_and_photos.html)
