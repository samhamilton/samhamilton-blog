Well things have got better in Shanghai, when I left 18 months ago I have 2M ADSL, then in Hangzhou we got 10M ADSL which they then decided was too fast and said their equipment could only handle 4M so after the end of the first year they downgraded us. Now back in Shanghai we have 20M fiber to the building (FTTB). It flies! I have also noticed that Akamai is now doing a much better job in China, Apple App Store updates are now whizzing down the line at nearly the full 20M.
