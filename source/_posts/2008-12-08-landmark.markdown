D-day is nearly upon me. The day when we finally move the companies website from our current 3rd party supplier (Channel Advisor) to our own OFBiz / Rackspace / Akamai website. While Channel Advisor's website has done us good for the last 3+ years its time to move onwards and upwards with something, well customisable.

OFBiz has proved to be a great platform for our warehouse and its really exciting to see the improved systems and processes take something to the next level. Working with developers who's first language is not your own is always a challenge but I think the end result has been worth it.

The first site to go live is our JV's site quickly followed by our own, should be a great week!
