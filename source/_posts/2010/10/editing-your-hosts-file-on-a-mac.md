title: Editing your hosts file on a Mac
categories: Apple
---

Found a new way to edit my hosts file while normally I would use vi this means that I can use TextEdit which sometimes is easier.

Open the Terminal:
`Applications > Utilities > Terminial`

Type the following and hit enter:
`sudo open -e /etc/hosts`

Or if you fancy vi then:
`sudo vi /etc/hosts`
