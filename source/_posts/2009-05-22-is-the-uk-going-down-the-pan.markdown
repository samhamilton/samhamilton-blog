Not sure really how much press this is getting but if the UK [looses its AAA credit rating](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/e46f01c4-45e3-11de-803f-00144feabdc0,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2Fe46f01c4-45e3-11de-803f-00144feabdc0.html&_i_referer=) I think that this is a slippery downward slope which can only further push the UK into a deeper recession
