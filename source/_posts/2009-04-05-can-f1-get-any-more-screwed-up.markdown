Its either McLaren or Lewis Hamilton who have a death wish, you start the first race of the season with a crap car, drive your heart out, get 4th then go and [lie about what happened](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/motorsport/formula_one/7978186.stm) on the track knowing full well that the FIA can listen to your radio chatter to the pit wall. [They are stark raving mad](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/f1mole/2009/04/hamilton-makes-a-swift-getaway.html).
