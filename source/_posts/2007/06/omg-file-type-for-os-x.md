So I downloaded something with this strange new extension. Never heard of it before and nothing by default plays it (its a movie).

I have Quicktime, Real Player, DivX and a copy of Windows media player installed on my Mac - so I did what everyone does these days, stuck it into Google.

The first page that comes up that seems to make sense refers me to DivX - well it don't work and I have version 6.

What does work is [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/) - not too well mind you as if you want to jump time the picture breaks up but hey least I can watch it.
