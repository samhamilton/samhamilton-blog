I have been using ChannelAdvisor for nearly two years now & when I was choosing which auction management system to use I knew about Marketworks but they were not in the same league - it was more aimed at lower volume sellers and how the dizzy heights I could see the company I am working for reaching.

Anyway ChannelAdvisor bought Marketworks - see their press release [here](http://www.channeladvisor.com/company/press_releases/2007/pr070912.html)

I had always assumed that there were more customers than that to make such a high GMV figure!
