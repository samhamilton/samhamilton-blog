I thought someone was pulling my leg when they told me this but then the BBC did its job and [blogged](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/andrewbenson/2009/03/when_bernie_ecclestone_first_p.html) about it soon after, not sure if I agree or disagree but sometimes there can be too many changes and you are not sure what really broke the system. Anyway this time they have changed the rules so that the driver with the most wins in the season NOT points wins the championship, which would have meant that Lewis Hamilton would not have won last year.

I am looking forward to the other changes they have made this season but was this one just a step too far?
