There are enough features now in this branch for us to make use of over the next year but what we really need is stability. I can see this process being massive in terms of both changes to our internal code and also time of the developers but i think it will be worth the effort. Going to wait a few weeks for some of the simple bugs to be fixed but its on the developers road map very soon." />
