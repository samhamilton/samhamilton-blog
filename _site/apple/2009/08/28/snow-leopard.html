    <p>To say I am looking forward to <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Snow Leopard</a> is an understatement - the prospect of getting rid of Microsoft Entourage is making me giddy, my only worry is that it won’t live up to the dream.

<p><img src="/images/226264941_f370cddafd-300x199.jpg" alt="snow leopard" />It seems some people might already have an early release as the articles are starting to come out including this from <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/08/26/snow-leopard-review/">Engadget</a> but more interestingly is the fact that I think this next one also from <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/08/26/entelligence-will-snow-leopards-exchange-support-earn-apple-a/">Engadget</a> is spot on, they talk about how the Exchange support will have people moving over in flocks. Perhaps not flocks but if they really have got it right and it all works as you expect Apple products to work then all that is left is for people to realise that iWork is a great product or OpenOffice gets their load time down to something under 30 seconds with some better web 2.0 style graphics then the whole world can tell Microsoft to stuff it.</p>
