I cant remember the last time I saw a [red flag, and the race be abandoned its been awhile](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/motorsport/formula_one/7984468.stm). Button wins the race but with only[ 1/2 the points](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/motorsport/formula_one/7984270.stm), [Massa is feeling cold](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/motorsport/formula_one/7984473.stm) about the season. Hamilton is still in [hot water](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/motorsport/formula_one/7983375.stm) but here are the [photos](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/motorsport/formula_one/7984155.stm) just in case you missed the race.
