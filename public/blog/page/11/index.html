	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Over the last couple of weeks I have been deeply involved with something that eBay calls VeRO - bascially this is a way that eBay pushes the responsilbity of checking for fake, patent or trademark infringing goods back onto the owners of those trademarks. The rights owner simply sends in an email to VeRO and eBay removes the item and warns the seller of those goods to contact the rights owner and sort it out.</p>

<p>For the most part the system works - execpt when you want to fix the &#8220;enfringment&#8221; and get it removed from your eBay history. At this point eBay basically make you get the rights owner to contact their VeRO contact and tell them that they made a mistake. You see eBay cant get involved in the fight - but the strick hoops they make you and the rights owners go through to get it removed is just well silly.</p>

<p>If the rights owner emails my eBay account manager that does not count, if they email customer support at eBay that also does not count - it has to be directly to VeRO. What a pain! Come on eBay - if a rights owner contacts you any how does it really matter - making them jump through more hoops just is sensless - especially when neally all the rights owners dont even know their own contact at VeRO.</p>

		<p>So got up this morning and was reading <a href="http://slashdot.org">Slashdot</a> with a cup of coffee and what do I read&#8230;. <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/06/09/1914226">China Sensoring Flickr</a></p>

<p>So as with most things related to the Chinese firewall you have to make sure it apples to you too and it does - I can get onto <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> but cant see any images.</p>

<p>And I was going to update my photos this week too.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>So I downloaded something with this strange new extension. Never heard of it before and nothing by default plays it (its a movie).</p>

<p>I have Quicktime, Real Player, DivX and a copy of Windows media player installed on my Mac - so I did what everyone does these days, stuck it into Google.</p>

<p>The first page that comes up that seems to make sense refers me to DivX - well it dont work and I have version 6.</p>

<p>What does work is <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a> - not too well mind you as if you want to jump time the picutre breaks up but hey least I can watch it.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I have to admit I have heard of Trackbacks years ago - but until I started blogging more frequently I never understood it.</p>

<p>I looked up a definition of how it works and when to use it - this post from <a href="http://www.optiniche.com/blog/117/wordpress-trackback-tutorial/trackback/">optiniche.com</a> will fit the bill.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The Chinese government has decided to change the amount of foreign currency exchanged into RMB on a personal level from $50,000 per month to $50,000 per year!</p>

<p>Quite a change and this caused great questions for the business that need to be answered - general taxpayer or warehouse in Hong Kong!?!</p>

<p>The change to come into effect Feb 1, 2007!</p>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2007/01/07/my-first-apple-a-macbook-pro/">My First Apple - a MacBook Pro</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Well I did it and took the plunge - I bought an Apple MacBook Pro. Lets just say that I read nearly every review under the sun about it, and I waited my time for the dual core to be release by Intel assuming that Apple would make the switch.</p>

<p>I bought it in the UK with a three year warrantee and only the 2GB of RAM, I am going on the assumption that by the time I need the third gig that RAM prices will have dropped below what Apple were charging for it on their website.</p>

<p>I got my boss to bring it back to China with him after Christmas all I could think when I got it out was wow! I am addicted to OS X, its crazy good.</p>

<p>I Love it!</p>

<p>I know why Jobs made the switch to Intel - its to tempt people like me to buy an Apple without the worry that we can never use Windows XP, yer I know Microsoft but at the end of the day Microsoft products are the ones that I have to use all day long to run the companies servers and desktops.</p>

<p>Just starting to download Bootcamp - and with Vista and Office 2007 release just round the corner I think this is the perfect test platform.</p>

<p>Pics to follow!</p>
