	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>So this morning I was as usual reading my subscribed blogs &amp; found out about this company that just got bought for some <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/09/23/breaking-online-backup-startup-mozy-acquired-by-emc-for-76-million/">stupid amount of money</a> &amp; so I thought I would have a nice little look and see why they are worth the money. I still don&#8217;t know to be honest why they were worth so much cash but I don&#8217;t mind because I found a nice and cheap backup system for my Apple which if you are a Apple user you will know that finding a cheap but good online backup system that support Mac is well&#8230; hard!</p>

<p>At this time the Mac support is beta but I really don&#8217;t mind too much as long as it does backup my stuff!</p>

<p>$4.99 for &#8220;unlimited&#8221; backup space - um&#8230;. I thought where is that <a href="https://mozy.com/?ref=7JTKA8">signup button</a></p>

<p>And with probably 90% of techies out there you have a parent who depends on you for help, so I pinged off an email to my Mum to subscribe too!</p>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2007/09/19/ofbiz-postgresql-and-a-worldwide-audience/">OFBiz, PostgreSQL and a Worldwide Audience</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>So we were starting to talk to <a href="http://www.netsuite.com">Netsuite</a> about replacing our systems with theirs, I have to admit I do like the idea of one complete system from one person. It was just before they were going public so they wanted all the business they could muster and we had a &#8220;good&#8221; price until we got into extra storage space. I mean what does 1GB of storage space cost these days even if you do run <a href="http://www.oracle.com">Oracle</a> databases like they do to at Netsuite. Well it just made the whole deal crazy the scale out plans made the deal practically blow up and this is with me supporting the integrated system totally and really thinking about the cost savings, it just no longer made sense.</p>

<p>Well fortunate as luck would have it we bumped into someone using OFBiz to run their warehouse here in China. To cut a long story short we then started working out how we could use it including getting me up to speed on Java which is a technology I have never touched. The fun begins we hire our first developer, we think which databases to use and we work out if this thing scales.</p>

<p>The database is an easy choice after a short amount of reading, <a href="http://www.postgresql.org">postgreSQL</a> is a clear winner - why? Well really it comes down to data integrity. We are not building a social media site so really we are not going to end up with huge amounts of database writes after all, instead we are going to end up (in a few short years) with TB&#8217;s of data.</p>

<p>The interesting part of the mix is that we need to have multiple database sites which include USA, UK, Hong Kong and China. The USA, UK and HK sites will be the ecommerce backbones and then also China as we need to ship the goods - the packing stations in the warehouse get PDF files of the address which can be quite large so a local server there keeps the speed and productivity up.</p>

<p>Let me explain why three data centeres - first you always have a primary data centre so for us this will be Hong Kong as this is physically closest to Shanghai so for any internal tool this need to be as fast as possible. We build out tools such as <a href="http://www.alfresco.com">Alfresco</a> and <a href="http://www.jivesoftware.com/products/clearspace">Clearspace</a> in Hong Kong plus also a copy of OFBiz as all the customer and order information is inside, this node can also provide service to any Asian ecommerce customers.</p>

<p>The US and UK sites are the main points of ecommerce so these sites primary function is to host anything customer facing and provide services using <a href="http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/117/css_glb_sticky.html">global load balancing</a> to ensure that each customer is getting just about the fastest response from our servers.</p>

<p>Having customers in 9+ primary and 50+ secondary countries really makes delivering a great experiance to them all hard.</p>

<p>Thats all for now - lets see how this gets on.</p>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2007/07/01/ebay-and-vero/">eBay and VeRO</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Over the last couple of weeks I have been deeply involved with something that eBay calls VeRO - bascially this is a way that eBay pushes the responsilbity of checking for fake, patent or trademark infringing goods back onto the owners of those trademarks. The rights owner simply sends in an email to VeRO and eBay removes the item and warns the seller of those goods to contact the rights owner and sort it out.</p>

<p>For the most part the system works - execpt when you want to fix the &#8220;enfringment&#8221; and get it removed from your eBay history. At this point eBay basically make you get the rights owner to contact their VeRO contact and tell them that they made a mistake. You see eBay cant get involved in the fight - but the strick hoops they make you and the rights owners go through to get it removed is just well silly.</p>

<p>If the rights owner emails my eBay account manager that does not count, if they email customer support at eBay that also does not count - it has to be directly to VeRO. What a pain! Come on eBay - if a rights owner contacts you any how does it really matter - making them jump through more hoops just is sensless - especially when neally all the rights owners dont even know their own contact at VeRO.</p>

		<p>So got up this morning and was reading <a href="http://slashdot.org">Slashdot</a> with a cup of coffee and what do I read&#8230;. <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/06/09/1914226">China Sensoring Flickr</a></p>

<p>So as with most things related to the Chinese firewall you have to make sure it apples to you too and it does - I can get onto <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> but cant see any images.</p>

<p>And I was going to update my photos this week too.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>So I downloaded something with this strange new extension. Never heard of it before and nothing by default plays it (its a movie).</p>

<p>I have Quicktime, Real Player, DivX and a copy of Windows media player installed on my Mac - so I did what everyone does these days, stuck it into Google.</p>

<p>The first page that comes up that seems to make sense refers me to DivX - well it dont work and I have version 6.</p>

<p>What does work is <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a> - not too well mind you as if you want to jump time the picutre breaks up but hey least I can watch it.</p>

<p>I looked up a definition of how it works and when to use it - this post from <a href="http://www.optiniche.com/blog/117/wordpress-trackback-tutorial/trackback/">optiniche.com</a> will fit the bill.</p>

		<p>The Chinese government has decided to change the amount of foreign currency exchanged into RMB on a personal level from $50,000 per month to $50,000 per year!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Well I did it and took the plunge - I bought an Apple MacBook Pro. Lets just say that I read nearly every review under the sun about it, and I waited my time for the dual core to be release by Intel assuming that Apple would make the switch.</p>

<p>I bought it in the UK with a three year warrantee and only the 2GB of RAM, I am going on the assumption that by the time I need the third gig that RAM prices will have dropped below what Apple were charging for it on their website.</p>

<p>I got my boss to bring it back to China with him after Christmas all I could think when I got it out was wow! I am addicted to OS X, its crazy good.</p>

<p>I Love it!</p>

<p>I know why Jobs made the switch to Intel - its to tempt people like me to buy an Apple without the worry that we can never use Windows XP, yer I know Microsoft but at the end of the day Microsoft products are the ones that I have to use all day long to run the companies servers and desktops.</p>

<p>Just starting to download Bootcamp - and with Vista and Office 2007 release just round the corner I think this is the perfect test platform.</p>

<p>Pics to follow!</p>
